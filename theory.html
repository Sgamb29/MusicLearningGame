                    <div class="section"><strong id="stepPatterns">Quick Ways To Make The Major or Minor Scales</strong><br>Whole and Half Step Pattern For The Major Scale:<br>
                <br><strong>W-W-H-W-W-W-H</strong><br><br><strong>H = Half Step W = Whole Step</strong><br>Examples of half steps: G to a G#, A to an A#, C to a C#, on guitar a half step is just one fret up from the last fret you were playing.
                The only notes that don't have a sharp when you go up a half step are E and B. The E note half steps up to F and the B note half steps up to C. A <strong>Whole Step</strong> is simply TWO half steps.<br>So to use the pattern to
                find the G major scale, you would start on the note G, then go up a whole step, another whole step, a half step, and 3 more whole steps in a row!
                <br><br>Whole and Half Step Pattern For The Minor Scale:<br><br><strong>W-H-W-W-H-W-W</strong><br><br>Works the same as the first pattern. You just pick a note (key) that you want to play the minor scale of and follow the whole
                and half step pattern!<br><br><strong>TIP:</strong><br>When you are playing a major scale. The 6th note of the scale is that scale's <em>relative minor scale</em>. Which means if you start on the 6 note you are playing a different key's
                minor scale that has the exact same notes in it as the major scale you were playing!<br>For example: The 6th note of the C Major scale is A, so the A minor scale has all the same notes in it as the C Major Scale, the only difference is you
                start on the A note (which makes A the <strong>tonic</strong> of the scale).<br><br></div><br><a href="#title">Jump To Top</a>

                <div class="section"><strong id="modes">Learn 7 Scales By Knowing Only One Major Scale: Modes</strong><br><br>Lets use C Major as an example. Depending on what note you start and end on in the C Major scale will give you a different <strong>Mode</strong> (scale).
                The order and names of the modes are:<br>Ionian<br>Dorian<br>Phrygian<br>Lydian<br>Mixolydian<br>Aeolian<br>Locrian<br><br><strong>So</strong> starting the C Major scale on the C note gives you the <strong>C Ionian</strong> mode, which is really
                just the usual major scale. If you start on the D note you get the <strong>D Dorian Mode</strong>. Start on E: <strong>E Phrygian Mode</strong>. F: <strong>F Lydian Mode</strong>. And it goes that way for the whole scale following the order of the modes. Note: The <strong>Aeolian Mode</strong> 
                of any scale is just the usual minor scale for that note!<br><br></div><br><a href="#title">Jump To Top</a><br><br>

                <strong id="chords">Finding What Chords To Play In a Major Or Minor Scale:</strong><br><br>
                Finding the chords to play in a scale follows a couple simple patterns. For the <strong>Major Scale</strong> starting on the root note <em>(tonic)</em> of the scale it goes:<br><br>
                <strong>Major Chord - Minor Chord - Minor Chord - Major Chord - Major Chord - Minor Chord - Diminished Chord</strong><br><br>So for the C Major Scale the chords would go: C Major, D minor, E minor, F Major, G Major, A minor, B diminished.<br><br>
                For the <strong>Minor Scale</strong> starting on the root note the pattern goes:<br><br><strong>Minor Chord - Diminished Chord - Major Chord - Minor Chord - Minor Chord - Major Chord - Major Chord</strong>

                <strong id="circleOfFifths">The Circle Of Fifths: A Quick Way To Find The Notes In A Major Scale:</strong>
                <br><br>
                NOTE: The C Major Scale Has No Sharps or Flats!<br>Using The Circle of Fifths To <em>Know What Sharps or Flats are In a Major Scale</em><br>A couple phrases for memorizing the sharps, the first one is:<br><br><strong>Goes Down And Ends Battles Father Charles</strong><br><br>
                The above phrase is for remembering the <strong>NUMBER</strong> of sharps in a scale (the scale is the first letter in each word). For example 'Goes' is the first word so there is 1 sharp in the G major scale. 'And' is the third word so A major has 3 sharps! 
                IMPORTANT: The last two words: 'Father' and 'Charles' stand for the scales F# Major and C# Major not F and C natural.<br>What you do next is use the second phrase to figure out what those sharps are:<br><br><strong>Father Charles Goes Down And Ends Battles</strong><br><br>
                So we know that A major has 3 sharps so we use the 1st 3 words in the SECOND phrase, and the first letter of each word will be the sharps. So for A Major: 'Father Charles Goes', A major has an F#, a C# and a G#.<br><br>NOW for the flats there are 2 more phrases that work the EXACT same way. 
                To count the NUMBER of flats in the scale use:<br><br><strong>Father's Battle Ends And Down Goes Charles</strong><br><br>IMPORTANT: The first word (first letter) in this phrase is the only natural scale and the rest are flat scales. So for F Major (first word 'Father's') it has 1 flat. The second phrase for flats:<br><br>
                <strong>Battle Ends And Down Goes Charles' Father</strong><br><br>So we know F Major has one flat so that flat is a B flat ('battle'). The E flat scale would be the 3rd word in the FIRST FLAT phrase 'Ends' so the E flat major scale has a Bb, Eb and an Ab. TIP: Another way to remember which flats there are in the scale is to remember B-E-A-D or BEAD and then GCF.<br><br>
                Whew, if you made it through that and are starting to understand it you're well on your way to music theory greatness! I recommend writing the phrases on some cards and doing your best to memorize them (or even come up with your own)!
